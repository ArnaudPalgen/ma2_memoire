  abstract = {Event-driven programming is a popular model for
                  writing programs for tiny embedded systems and
                  sensor network nodes. While event-driven programming
                  can keep the memory overhead down, it enforces a
                  state machine programming style which makes many
                  programs difficult to write, maintain, and debug. We
                  present a novel programming abstraction called
                  protothreads that makes it possible to write
                  event-driven programs in a thread-like style, with a
                  memory overhead of only two bytes per
                  protothread. We show that protothreads significantly
                  reduce the complexity of a number of widely used
                  programs previously written with event-driven state
                  machines. For the examined programs the majority of
                  the state machines could be entirely removed. In the
                  other cases the number of states and transitions was
                  drastically decreased. With protothreads the number
                  of lines of code was reduced by one third. The
                  execution time overhead of protothreads is on the
                  order of a few processor cycles.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are composed of large
                  numbers of tiny networked devices that communicate
                  untethered. For large scale networks it is important
                  to be able to dynamically download code into the
                  network. In this paper we present Contiki, a
                  lightweight operating system with support for
                  dynamic loading and replacement of individual
                  programs and services. Contiki is built around an
                  event-driven kernel but provides optional preemptive
                  multithreading that can be applied to individual
                  processes. We show that dynamic loading and
                  unloading is feasible in a resource constrained
                  environment, while keeping the base system
                  lightweight and compact.},

abstract = {Several studies have highlighted that the IEEE 802.15.4 standard presents a number of limitations such as low reliability, unbounded packet delays and no protection against interference/fading, that prevent its adoption in applications with stringent requirements in terms of reliability and latency. Recently, the IEEE has released the 802.15.4e amendment that introduces a number of enhancements/modifications to the MAC layer of the original standard in order to overcome such limitations. In this paper we provide a clear and structured overview of all the new 802.15.4e mechanisms. After a general introduction to the 802.15.4e standard, we describe the details of the main 802.15.4e MAC behavior modes, namely Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH), Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (DSME), and Low Latency Deterministic Network (LLDN). For each of them, we provide a detailed description and highlight the main features and possible application domains. Also, we survey the current literature and summarize open research issues.}
